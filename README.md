1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gonthegeek/LearningJournal.git
   cd LearningJournal
   ```

2. **Copy environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase credentials** in `.env`:
   ```env
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   TEACHER_EMAIL=teacher@yourdomain.com
   ```

### Local Development

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Serve locally**:
   ```bash
   cd public
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Firebase Security Rules

Configure Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId} {
      // Students can only access their own data
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Teachers can read all student data and update reflection feedback
      allow read, list: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == "teacher@yourdomain.com";
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.token.email == "teacher@yourdomain.com" &&
                       resource.data.keys().hasAny(['reflection']) &&
                       request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['reflection']);
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Client-Side Security
- **Firebase Configuration**: Client-side config values are public by design
- **Authentication Required**: All data access requires valid authentication
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Automatic teacher/student role assignment
- **Data Isolation**: Students cannot access other students' data

### Server-Side Security
- **Firestore Rules**: Comprehensive database security rules
- **Admin Permissions**: Teacher access restricted by email validation
- **Update Limitations**: Teachers can only modify reflection feedback
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration via environment variables

### Cost Management
- **Optimized Reads**: Manual refresh system reduces Firebase costs
- **Efficient Queries**: Targeted data fetching for specific use cases
- **Connection Management**: Minimal real-time listeners
- **Batch Operations**: Grouped database operations where possible
